SMILECARE DENTAL - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & POLICIES

=== APPOINTMENT QUESTIONS ===

Q: How do I schedule an appointment?
A: You can call us at +1 (920) 891-4513 anytime - our AI assistant Dentsi is available 24/7 to help you book. You can also visit our website or walk in during office hours.

Q: What if I need to cancel or reschedule?
A: Please give us at least 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. This allows us to offer the time slot to another patient who may need care.

7. Cleaning (if time permits and no urgent issues)

Q: Should I eat before my appointment?
A: For regular appointments, eating beforehand is fine. If you're having sedation or oral surgery, you'll receive specific fasting instructions.

=== DENTAL PROCEDURE QUESTIONS ===

Q: Does getting a filling hurt?
A: We use local anesthesia (numbing shots) to ensure you don't feel pain during the procedure. You may feel some pressure. Many patients say they barely felt anything!

Q: How long does a root canal take?
A: Most root canals take 60-90 minutes for front teeth and up to 2 hours for molars. The procedure is usually completed in one visit, though some complex cases may require two visits.

Q: Is teeth whitening safe?
A: Yes, professional teeth whitening is safe when done under dental supervision. Some patients experience temporary sensitivity, which usually resolves within a few days.

Q: How long do dental implants last?
A: With proper care, dental implants can last 25 years or even a lifetime. They have a 95%+ success rate.

Q: Do I really need to get my wisdom teeth removed?
A: Not everyone needs wisdom teeth removed. We'll evaluate whether yours are causing problems or likely to in the future. Common reasons for removal include impaction, crowding, or decay.

=== DENTAL ANXIETY QUESTIONS ===

Q: I'm scared of the dentist. Can you help?
A: Absolutely! We specialize in treating anxious patients:
- We explain everything before we do it
- You're always in control - raise your hand if you need a break
- We offer headphones with music or TV on the ceiling
- Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is available
- Oral sedation can be arranged for very anxious patients
- IV sedation is available for surgical procedures

Q: What is nitrous oxide?
A: Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a safe, mild sedative you breathe through a mask. It helps you relax during treatment but wears off within minutes. You can drive yourself home after.

Q: Can I be completely asleep during dental work?
A: Yes, we offer IV sedation for surgical procedures and patients with severe dental anxiety. You'll need someone to drive you home afterward.

=== EMERGENCY QUESTIONS ===

Q: What counts as a dental emergency?
A: Call us immediately for:
- Severe tooth pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter painkillers
- Knocked-out tooth (bring the tooth in milk!)
- Broken tooth with sharp edges or pain
- Swelling in face or gums
- Bleeding that won't stop
- Lost filling or crown with pain
- Dental abscess (pimple on gums with pain/swelling)

Q: Do you see emergency patients same-day?
A: Yes! We reserve time each day for emergencies. Call us as early as possible and we'll fit you in.

Q: What should I do if a tooth gets knocked out?
A: Act fast! Pick up the tooth by the crown (not the root), gently rinse if dirty, and try to place it back in the socket. If you can't, keep it moist in milk or saliva. Get to us within 30 minutes for the best chance of saving it.

Q: I have a toothache at night. What can I do until morning?
A: Try these until you can see us:
- Take over-the-counter pain relievers (ibuprofen works well)
- Apply a cold compress to your cheek
- Rinse with warm salt water
- Avoid very hot, cold, or sweet foods
- Call our emergency line for severe pain
