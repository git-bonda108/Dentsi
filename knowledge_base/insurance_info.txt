=== UNDERSTANDING YOUR DENTAL BENEFITS ===

ANNUAL MAXIMUM
Most dental plans have an annual maximum benefit (typically $1,000-$2,500). This is the most your insurance will pay in a calendar year. We help you maximize these benefits with smart treatment planning.

DEDUCTIBLE
Many plans have an annual deductible ($25-$100) that you pay before insurance kicks in. Preventive services often don't require meeting the deductible.

COVERAGE LEVELS (Typical)
- Preventive Care (cleanings, exams, x-rays): 100% covered
- Basic Services (fillings, extractions): 80% covered
- Major Services (crowns, root canals): 50% covered
- Orthodontics (braces): 50% covered (often separate lifetime max)

WAITING PERIODS
Some plans have waiting periods for major services (6-12 months). We can check your specific plan.

FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS
- Cleanings: Usually 2 per year (some plans allow 2 per calendar year, others every 6 months)
- X-rays: Bitewings usually every 12 months, full mouth every 3-5 years
- Exams: Usually 2 per year

=== INSURANCE TIPS ===

MAXIMIZE YOUR BENEFITS:
1. Use your preventive benefits - cleanings and exams are usually 100% covered
2. Don't let your annual maximum roll over unused - it doesn't accumulate
3. If you need major work, we can phase treatment across calendar years to maximize benefits
4. Schedule a year-end appointment if you have unused benefits

COMMON INSURANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: Why didn't my insurance cover everything?
A: Insurance plans have limitations (annual max, percentages, waiting periods). We always provide estimates, but final coverage depends on your specific plan.

Q: Can you tell me exactly what my insurance will pay?
A: We provide estimates based on your plan information, but only your insurance company can give exact benefit amounts.

Q: What if my insurance denies a claim?
A: We'll appeal on your behalf if appropriate. Some denials can be overturned with additional documentation.

Q: I just got new insurance. When can I use it?
A: You can use new insurance immediately for preventive care. Major services may have waiting periods - check your plan details.
