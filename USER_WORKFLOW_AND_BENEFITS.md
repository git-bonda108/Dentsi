# 💰 BUSINESS BENEFITS & ROI

## 📈 Revenue Impact

### **Small Practice (1 Location)**

**Scenario: 3-doctor dental practice**

**Without Dentra:**
- 20 calls/day × 30% missed = 6 missed calls/day
- 6 missed × 5 days/week × 50 weeks = 1,500 missed calls/year
- 1,500 calls × 30% would book = 450 lost appointments/year
- 450 appointments × $2,000 average lifetime value = **$900,000 lost revenue**

**With Dentra:**
- 0 missed calls (AI answers 24/7)
- 450 additional appointments booked
- **$900,000 in captured revenue**
- Dentra annual cost: ~$10,000-$15,000
- **ROI: 60x-90x return**

---

### **Medium Practice (3-5 Locations)**

**Scenario: 5-location dental group**

**Without Dentra:**
- Each location loses $900K/year (per above)
- 5 locations × $900K = **$4.5M lost annually**

**With Dentra:**
- Captures that $4.5M in revenue
- Reduces receptionist workload by 60%
